# alphabet-detection
This project aims to detect and recognize sign language alphabets using computer vision techniques. Currently, it supports the detection of five alphabets: A, B, C, L, and Y. Leveraging libraries such as MediaPipe and OpenCV, the system processes image input from user and identifies hand gestures corresponding to these alphabets.
